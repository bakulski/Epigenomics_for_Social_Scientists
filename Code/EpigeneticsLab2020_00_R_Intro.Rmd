# Software used

## Programming language: R

The programming language used here is R, which is a primarily used for statistical computing. More information can be found here <https://www.r-project.org/>.

## IDE: Rstudio

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is fancy language for a piece of software that consolidates different elements of coding. We can see this in the 4 paneled window we are looking at.

## Authoring Software: RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

## Common new R users frustrations

1.  Different versions of software
    - RStudio Cloud solves this
2.  Working directory problems: trying to read files that R "can't find"
    - RStudio Cloud solves this and so does RStudio Projects
3.  Data type problems (is that a string or a number?)
    - discussed throughout
4.  Typos (R is **case sensitive**, `x` and `X` are different)
    - RStudio helps with "tab completion"
    - discussed throughout

## Explaining commands/output

An R command (we'll also call it code or a code chunk) will be grey and look like this

```{r code}
print("I'm code")
```

And then directly after it, will be the output of the code.  
So `print("I'm code")` is the code chunk and [1] "I'm code" is the output.

## R as a calculator
 The R console is a full calculator
 Try to play around with it:
     +, -, /, * are add, subtract, divide and multiply
     ^ or ** is power
     parentheses -- ( and ) -- work with order of operations 
     
```{r calcDemo}
2 + 2
2 * 4
2 ^ 3

2 + (2 * 3)^2
(1 + 3) / 2 + 45
```

Note, when you type your command, R inherently thinks you want to print the result. 

Try evaluating the following:

 `2 + 2 * 3 / 4 -3`
 `2 * 3 / 4 * 2`
 `2^4 - 1`

## Commenting in Scripts
`#` is the comment symbol in R

```{r comments}
# Comments in R follow the hashtag symbol
# Nothing to its right is evaluated. Note the color of your code changes after you use a hashtag

# This # is still a comment
### You can use many #'s as you want
1 + 2 # Can be the right of code

# Best practice is to take a ton of notes to help your future self and anyone who comes later to re-run your code
```

## R variables 
* You can create variables from within the R environment and from files on your computer
* R uses "<-"or "=" to assign values to a variable name
* Variable names are case-sensitive, i.e. X and x are different

```{r assign}
x <- 2 # Same as: x = 2
x
x * 4
x + 2
```

## R variable classes
* The most comfortable and familiar class/data type for many of you will be `data.frame`
* You can think of these as essentially Excel spreadsheets with rows (usually subjects or observations) and columns (usually variables)
`data.frame`s are somewhat advanced objects in R; we will start with simpler objects;
* Here we introduce "1 dimensional" classes; often referred to as 'vectors'
* Vectors can have multiple sets of observations, but each observation has to be the same class.

```{r vector_class}
class(x)
y <- "hello world!"
print(y)
class(y)
```

## R variable practice
Try assigning your full name to an R variable called `name`

```{r myName}
name <- "Kelly Bakulski"
name
```

## The 'combine' function
The function `c()` collects/combines/joins single R objects into a vector of R objects. It is mostly used for creating vectors of numbers, character strings, and other data types. 
```{r combine}
x <- c(1, 4, 6, 8)
x
class(x)
```

## The 'combine' function practice
Try assigning your first and last name as 2 separate character strings into a length-2 vector called `name2`

```{r myName2}
name2 <- c("Kelly","Bakulski")
name2
```

## The 'length' function
`length()`: Get or set the length of vectors (including lists) and factors, and of any other R object for which a method has been defined.
```{r length}
length(x)
y
length(y)
```

## The 'length' function  practice
What do you expect for the length of the `name` variable? What about the `name2` variable?

What are the lengths of each?
```{r length_name}
length(name)
length(name2)
```

## R functions on vectors
You can perform functions to entire vectors of numbers very easily.
```{r functions_vectors}
x + 2
x * 3
x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## R functions on vectors depend on class
But things like algebra can only be performed on numbers.
```{r, error=TRUE}
name2 + 4
```

## R assign new vectors
And save these modified vectors as a new vector.
```{r assign_new_vector}
y <- x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y 
```

Note that the R object `y` is no longer "Hello  World!" - It has effectively been overwritten by assigning new data to the variable

## The structure function
You can get more attributes than just class.  The function `str` gives you the structure of the object.
```{r structure}
str(x)
str(y)
```
This tells you that `x` is a numeric vector and tells you the length.


## Review
* Creating a new script
* Using R as a calculator
* Assigning values to variables
* Performing algebra on numeric variables
